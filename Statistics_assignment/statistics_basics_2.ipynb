They provide insight into how the values in a dataset are distributed around the central tendency (mean, median, or mode). Here's how each of these measures is used and an example to illustrate their utility:\n",
    "1. Range:\n",
    "    The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "    It provides an idea of the total spread of data.\n",

    "    Suppose you have a dataset of exam scores for a class, and the range of scores is from 50 to 95. The range in this case is 95 - 50 = 45, indicating that the scores vary by 45 points from the lowest to the highest.\n",

A higher variance indicates greater variability in daily temperatures.\n",

    "3. Standard Deviation:\n",
    "    The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is often preferred as it is in the same unit as the data.\n",
